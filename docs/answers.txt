4. branches are useful for bug fixes to provide a seperate environment to fix bugs without chaning ongoing devlopment, and 
   branches allow multiple developers to work on new features without affecting the stability of the main codebase

5. git log shows the commit history while git status reveals the current working changes and staging status

6. git log -- Vehicle.h

7. git log --grep="file"

8. Inheritance: A way for one class to get all the stuff from another class
   Polymorphism: Lets us use a single action to mean different things for different objects
   Encapsulation: Keeping the details hidden inside and only showing what's necessary outside

9. Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow: A single leader integrates changes from managers of different project parts
   Integration Manager Workflow: An integration manager merges contributions directly from all developers into the main project

10. In the "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow, dividing the work among several leaders helps manage lots of developers' work better,
    avoiding the jam that can happen when one person tries to handle everything, like in a "Centralized"workflow.
